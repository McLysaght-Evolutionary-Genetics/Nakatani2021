Species are represented by five letter codes, and paralogs and orthologs are found in the following files.
paralogs/[species].txt
orthologs/[species]-[species].txt

Segments are defined in the following files.
segments/map/[species].txt: (segment name, chromosome/scaffold, start position, end position)
segment/seg/[species].txt: (segment name, chromosome/scaffold, gene list)

Scallop chromosomes and freshwater snail linkage groups are defined in the following files.
invertebrates/CHLFA.txt: (scallop chr1, ..., chr19)
invertebrates/BIOGL.txt: (freshwater snail LGa, ..., LGx)

The reconstructions are defined in the following files.
reconstructions/protovertebrate.txt: (Each line shows the 18 proto-vertebrate chromosome name and the list of amphioxus scaffolds that were assigned to the chromosome.)
reconstructions/protocyclostome.txt: (Each line shows the proto-cyclostome chromosome name and the list of lamprey segments.)
reconstructions/protognathostome.txt: (The file defines the 49 proto-gnathostome chromosomes.)
